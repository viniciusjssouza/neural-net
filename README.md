# neural-net

This repo contains my own Neural Network implementation, used for academic purposes. As so, it is not optimized for long inputs.
The following configurations are supported:

Neuron types:
- Multilayer Perceptron;
- Kohonen Maps / Self-organizing Maps;

Activation Functions:
- Sigmoid;
- Step;

Training:
- Back-propagation;
- Competitive learning;

Supported Techniques:
- Weight regularization;
- Momentum term;
